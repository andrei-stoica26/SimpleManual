Version: 0.1.0
Author: Andrei-Florian Stoica
Maintainer: Andrei-Florian Stoica <andreistoica@foxmail.com>
Description: This package contains a single function designed to generate a reference manual as an alternative to build_manual from devtools, which requires additional dependencies (e.g., texlive-fonts-extra), and to Rd2pdf, which titles the tables of contents as R documented topics.
